## Old Files (Can be Removed)

The following folders are no longer needed but kept for reference:
```
resources/[core]/esx_progressbar/nui/
resources/[core]/esx_textui/nui/
resources/[core]/esx_notify/nui/
```

## Required Dependencies

Ensure these are in your server.cfg in the correct order:

```cfg
# Core Libraries
ensure ox_lib

# ESX Core
ensure es_extended
ensure cron

# ESX UI Resources (now using ox_lib)
ensure esx_notify
ensure esx_textui
ensure esx_progressbar
```

## Testing Required

Please test all three resources to ensure:
1. Progress bars work correctly
2. Text UI displays and hides properly
3. Notifications appear with correct styling
4. All animations and positions work as expected

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing resource scripts using these exports will continue to work without modification.

No changes needed to scripts that use:
- `exports['esx_progressbar']:Progressbar()`
- `ESX.TextUI()` / `ESX.HideUI()`
- `ESX.ShowNotification()`
